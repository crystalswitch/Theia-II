Rviz is the visiulazing tool for move it and it says it is the fastest way.
The beginning part of move it is n the following link: http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html
ROS Melodic is less stabil than kinetic so the tutorial is for kinetic



For modeling an arm we use MoveIt Setup Assistant:
Make sure you have the Franka description package for Kinetic: sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-franka-description
to start assistant the command to use is : roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch
At this screen there are two options, creating new one or editing a previus one. We should select "new one"
Then select the Self-Collisions then press the Regenerate Default Collusion Matrix //in here a basic arm shows up then you costumize it how you want but for doing these changes
Then click on the Planning Groups>Add Group> then add the parts joints etc.
Robot poses gives us the angles between joints so we can set them
After all we should add end effector // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfcXZcKZd8A in this link it tells most of the topic 
at the end we can simulate it on gazebo thus it is able to control with ros control // http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control



RVIZ:
Launch the Demo and Configure the Plugin> the command for that is "roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch rviz_tutorial:=true" // this launches the demo then we select the arm we designed
